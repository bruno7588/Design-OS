description: 5Mins.ai design system for building admin and learner UI. Use whenever writing or editing any UI code in this repo - components, pages, screens, styles, CSS - or making any decision about colors, typography, spacing, icons, buttons, tables, overlays, forms, navigation, or any other visual element. Trigger before writing any TSX or CSS that renders UI. Routes to the Figma-verified component docs in docs/design-system/ and carries the strict token rules.

# 5Mins.ai design system

When building any UI component, feature, or screen, read the relevant design system documentation below before writing code. Also check `src/components/` for an existing shared component before building anything new - never improvise a custom component.


## How to use the design system docs

All component docs are Figma-verified (2026-07, with node refs in each file). **Prototype directly from these md files — do not fetch Figma links or screenshots for components that have a doc.** If a task needs a component that has no doc below, do not improvise or adapt a "close enough" pattern silently: say which component is missing and ask for the Figma link, then create its doc before/while building.

1. **Always start** with `docs/design-system/design-system-guidelines.md` — the design foundations (colors incl. the three-amber selection tokens, typography, spacing, radius, icons, accessibility) plus quick decision tables. Component specs live in the per-component docs.
2. **Then read the specific component doc** for detailed implementation (React TypeScript code, full CSS, usage examples):
   - `docs/design-system/buttons.md` — Button system: Filled/Outlined/Outlined-2/Text/Link + Danger/Warning/Success families + AI gradient buttons; 3 sizes, all states incl. Loading; trailing icons

## Strict rules

- **Never improvise design values.** Use only tokens defined in the design system (colors, spacing, radius, font sizes).
- **Always use semantic tokens over raw palette values.** Prefer `--text-primary` over `--neutral-800`, `--cards-background` over `--neutral-0`, `--border` over `--neutral-100`.
- **Always use Poppins** as the font family. Weights: 400, 500, 600, 700 only.
- **Always use Iconsax React** for icons. Standard sizes: 16, 20, 24, 32px only.
- **All spacing must be multiples of 2px or 4px.** Use the spacing scale tokens.
- **Never use `--primary-500` for text on white backgrounds** — it fails WCAG contrast.
- **Bold (700) is only for headings and buttons.** Semibold (600) for form-field labels. Medium (500) for subtle emphasis. Regular (400) for body text.
- **Follow the component patterns exactly** — button pairing, overlay selection, badge type mapping, header hierarchy, table card-row structure (each row a bordered rounded card with a gap between rows, never a gridlined table).
