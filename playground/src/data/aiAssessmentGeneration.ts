 * Volume follows the reading: one assessment per lesson, floored at 3 so a one-lesson
 * course still gets a set worth reviewing, and capped at 8 so a long course does not
 * bury the outline in drafts the admin has to curate one by one. An explicit number in
 * the instructions overrides both — if they asked for six, six is the answer.
 *
 * Formats cycle through ASSESSMENT_TYPES, which is ordered most-reached-for first — so
 * a short course gets the formats admins actually use, and a longer one earns the rarer
 * ones rather than opening with them. Naming formats in the instructions replaces that
 * cycle with the ones named, in the order the picker would have shown them.
 *
 * Returned expanded rather than as counts because that is what generateSet consumes:
 * one entry, one assessment. A repeated type is simply more of it.
