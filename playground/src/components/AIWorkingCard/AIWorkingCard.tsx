 * where the work has got to, not what it intends.
 *
 * No bar and no clock: neither could say how far along the work is, so both were
 * measuring the wait rather than describing it. The named steps do the describing, and
 * the sparkle's motion is what says it is still going.
 *
 * Inline content, not an overlay, so it drops into whatever body is waiting for the
 * result. Render it where the output will land: the card doubles as a placeholder for
 * the thing being generated.
 *
 * Ported from the roles panel's `.roles-ai-working-card`, which still carries its own
 * copy of this markup — the two will drift until RolePanel is moved over.
