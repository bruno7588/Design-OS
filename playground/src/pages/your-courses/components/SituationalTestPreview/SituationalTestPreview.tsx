 * renderer the format is played with everywhere else (`quiz-lab/formats/*`, the same
 * ones the assessment drawer and the course preview open). Nothing is re-drawn here:
 * the shuffle, the word bank, the buckets and the grading are the real thing, so what
 * the admin approves is what the learner meets.
 *
 * The way through is the learner's own: Start Situational Test opens the first question
 * and each Continue moves to the next, so the admin takes the same path they would. Just
 * the phone on the scrim — no dialog card, no paging beside it. ConfirmModal supplies the
 * scrim, focus trap and Escape, and it is portalled to the body because the drawer's
 * z-index makes a stacking context the overlay couldn't paint over.
